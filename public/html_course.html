        <h1>About HTML</h1>
        <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.</p>
        <p>It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.</p>
