        <h1>About C Programming</h1>
        <p>C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system.</p>
        <p>By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions. It has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language.</p>
